# FitAI

## Overview

The **FitAI** is a powerful web application designed to create personalized fitness and diet plans tailored to individual needs. By harnessing the capabilities of Googleâ€™s Gemini AI, this tool analyzes user input to generate comprehensive workout and nutrition plans, ensuring users can effectively reach their fitness goals. 

### How It Works

Upon launching the app, users are guided through a series of input fields that gather essential information such as age, height, weight, fitness goals, dietary preferences, and any body sensitivities. Once the user submits their information, the AI processes these inputs using a predefined prompt that simulates the expertise of a professional trainer and dietitian. The result is a customized plan delivered in a structured format that includes diet recommendations, exercise routines, and additional tips.

This approach not only personalizes the experience but also leverages AI to ensure users receive data-driven advice tailored to their unique lifestyles and preferences.
